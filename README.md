__TERESA STORE__

This project was created to practice my skills in JavaScript and Bootstrap 5, while also taking advantage of the opportunity to create something visually appealing. My project is an exact replica of one of the major companies in Chile. I drew inspiration from it and challenged myself by ensuring responsiveness across various screen sizes. I hope this page can be helpful to those who want to create a similar webpage.
